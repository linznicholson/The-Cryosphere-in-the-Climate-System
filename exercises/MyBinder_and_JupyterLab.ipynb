This service allows us to create a custom computing environment that can be shared and used by many remote users ([MyBinder Documentation](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The big advantage of this service is that no one has to install anything on there computers and can start right away doing the exercises.\n",

This means all your calculations are lost and you have to restart the whole notebook. Inactive means that no text is written and no code is executed. This is not a very big deal, you can start the Kernel again (see section [Restart Kernel](#Restart-Kernel)). But here is the first trap. \n",

The open notebooks are displayed on the right side of the screen and you can switch between the open ones by using the tabs.

The current Kernel of a notebook is displayed in the top right corner of the notebook view. An active Kernel displays 'Python 3' and inactive Kernel displays 'No Kernel'.
